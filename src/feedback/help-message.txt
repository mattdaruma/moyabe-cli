When running the MoYaBe CLI, there are three parts to the command: 
  1. The system command, 'moyabe' by default.  The command registered with your OS to trigger this CLI.
  2. The MoYaBe command.  The first word after the system command that isn't preceded by two --dashes.
    2a. Example: help
  3. MoYaBe parameters.  These are preceded by two dashes and have a value following an equal sign.
    3a. Example: --example=value
    3b. There are no spaces between key and value in parameters.
    3c. If you need spaces in the value, wrap it in quotes, like --example="value value"
  * System command, MoYaBe command, and parameters must all be separated by spaces.


Valid commands are:
  help - Bring up this menu.
  generate - I don't know I'm still making it up probably make an app or something.
